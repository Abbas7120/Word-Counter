**Word-Counter :**
It is basically a mini web project which is concerned with counting of values typed in a particular section . 
This project enhances the skill of using Javascript .
HTML , CSS , Javascript are the basic things required to made this .

**HTML :**
In this I created a container which contains whole of the Structure.
H1 tag for heading .
Textarea tag for making a particular type section ,
button tag is used for onclicking to get words count .
output in H2 tag used for printing output with JS .

**CSS :**
CSS is used for styling of the UI of this HTML Structure.
In all tags of HTML CSS is used .

**JavaScript :**
In this , first of all we select the btn tag and onclick is applied on it i.e. when we click on it JS perform a function which is responsible for counting the value or words in which it calls words or select the textarea using .getelementbyid and count the value and length :
 wordcount(document.getElementById("words").value.length);
wordcount which is a function after counting it returns its answer in output as innerHTML i.e. 
document.getElementById("output").innerHTML="Words Length is " + words + "ðŸ˜Ž";
